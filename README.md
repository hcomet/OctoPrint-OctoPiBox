# OctoPiBox Plugin

## Attention: Under development

OctoPiBox combines a Raspberry Pi, [OctoPrint](http://octoprint.org/), the [pigpio library](http://abyz.co.uk/rpi/pigpio/pigpiod.html),
some relays, a ULN2803, some switches and LEDs in a 3D printed case to provide power management for your 3D printer. The OctoPiBox plugin
allows for remote power-on/off as well as automatic timed power-off of your printer.

Plugin ideas were based on ideas and code found in the [AutomaticShutdown](http://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/automaticshutdown/)
and [DisplayZ](http://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/displayz/) plugins.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
or manually using this URL:

the plugin manager.

## Configuration

**TODO:** Describe your plugin's configuration options (if any).
